It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany with more than ten million inhabitants.</p>\n<p>Cologne is located on both sides of the Rhine River, less than eighty kilometres from Belgium. The city's famous Cologne Cathedral (<i>K\u00f6lner Dom</i>) is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. The University of Cologne (<i>Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln</i>) is one of Europe's oldest and largest universities.</p>\n<p>Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the first century AD as the Roman <i>Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium</i>, from which it gets its name. \"Cologne\", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of <i>Germania Inferior</i> and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Up until World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918\u20131926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping 34,711 long tons of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.</p>\n<p>Cologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland; it hosts more than thirty museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows such as Art Cologne, imm Cologne, Gamescom, and the Photokina.</p>\n<p></p>\n", "wplink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne", "title": "Cologne"}
