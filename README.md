This GitHub project contains the following contributions to the AskNow UI:
  * RelationLinker contains classes to create a Lucene index from text files containing Wikidata properties, and to search that index. The README in that folder contains information on how to run these Java files.
  * wikidata-properties contains the Wikidata properties in text files (as of April 2017), and lucene-index contains the corresponding Lucene index.
  * asknow-UI contains AskNow demonstrator files. They are to be used within Google App Engine; the README in that folder contains detailed information.
